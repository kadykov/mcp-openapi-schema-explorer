- Updated all test mocks to include new RequestHandlerExtra properties (sendNotification, sendRequest)
- Modified test files:
  - component-map-handler.test.ts
  - component-detail-handler.test.ts
  - operation-handler.test.ts
  - path-item-handler.test.ts
  - top-level-field-handler.test.ts
- All tests passing successfully
- Server now loads OpenAPI v3.0 and Swagger v2.0 specs from local files or remote URLs
- Swagger v2.0 specs are automatically converted to v3.0
- Internal references are transformed to MCP URIs
- Added `json-minified` output format option
- Server name is now dynamically set based on the loaded spec's `info.title`
- Automated versioning and release process implemented using `semantic-release`
- CI workflow adapted for Node 22, uses `just` for checks, and includes a `release` job
- Docker support added with automated Docker Hub publishing
- Dependencies correctly categorized
- Resource completion logic implemented
- Dynamic server name implemented
- Minified JSON output format added
- Remote spec loading and Swagger v2.0 conversion support added
- Core resource exploration functionality remains operational
- Unit tests updated for latest SDK version
